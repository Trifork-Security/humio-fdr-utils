# Humio FDR Utilities

This [Humio Package](https://docs.humio.com/docs/packages/)  gives content to Humio that can aid and assist in formatting and parsing of data coming from CrowdStrike's Falcon platform with FDR.

The utiities are based on the data ingested are coming from the FDR parser bundled with the Humio package `crowdstrike/fdr`.

For ingesting the data this project assumes the use of [fdr2humio](https://github.com/humio/fdr2humio) project.

Documentation for understanding FDR and the events given, please refer to the documentation within the Falcon Platform.

This repository is still under development. Content, guidance, documentation etc. will be added on an ongoing basis.
